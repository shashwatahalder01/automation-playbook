# 🔒 Advanced Security Testing in Automation

## 📌 Introduction

Security testing is crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of applications. Automated security testing integrates security practices into the testing lifecycle to identify vulnerabilities early. This guide covers:

- Automating security vulnerability scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite
- Implementing security tests in CI/CD pipelines
- Secrets management and secure test data handling

---

## 🔹 Automating Security Vulnerability Scanning

Automated vulnerability scanning helps detect security risks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and misconfigurations before deployment.

### ✅ Best Practices for Security Scanning

- **Perform Regular Scans** – Schedule automated scans in CI/CD.
- **Integrate with Development Workflow** – Detect vulnerabilities during development.
- **Use Multiple Tools** – Combine tools for enhanced coverage.
- **Analyze Reports** – Address vulnerabilities promptly.

### 🏗 Example OWASP ZAP Automation (Python)

```python
from zapv2 import ZAPv2

zap = ZAPv2()
zap.urlopen('https://example.com')
zap.spider.scan('https://example.com')
while int(zap.spider.status()) < 100:
    time.sleep(2)
print(zap.spider.results())
```

### 🛠 Security Testing Tools

| Tool           | Features                                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **OWASP ZAP**  | Automated security scanning, passive/active testing |
| **Burp Suite** | Manual and automated security testing               |
| **Nikto**      | Web server security scanner                         |
| **Arachni**    | Comprehensive web application security testing      |

## 🔹 Implementing Security Tests in CI/CD Pipelines

Security testing should be an integral part of DevOps workflows to catch vulnerabilities early in development.

### ✅ Security in CI/CD Pipelines

- **Integrate Security Scanning** – Run automated security tools in CI/CD.
- **Set Security Gates** – Prevent deployment if vulnerabilities exceed a threshold.
- **Use Static & Dynamic Analysis** – Combine static code analysis with runtime testing.
- **Automate Compliance Checks** – Ensure adherence to security policies.

### 🏗 Example Security Scan in GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push]
jobs:
  zap_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run OWASP ZAP Scan
        uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.1.0
        with:
          target: "https://example.com"
```

### 🛠 CI/CD Security Tools

| Tool          | Features                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **SonarQube** | Static code analysis for security issues   |
| **Snyk**      | Dependency and container security scanning |
| **Trivy**     | Security scanning for containers           |
| **Gauntlt**   | Security tests as part of CI/CD            |

## 🔹 Secrets Management and Secure Test Data Handling

Ensuring that sensitive data is protected during testing is essential for security compliance.

### ✅ Best Practices for Secure Test Data

- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets** – Use environment variables or secrets management tools.
- **Use Vaults for Secrets Management** – Tools like HashiCorp Vault store sensitive information securely.
- **Mask Sensitive Data in Logs** – Prevent exposure of credentials.
- **Encrypt Test Data** – Ensure data protection in transit and storage.

### 🏗 Example Using AWS Secrets Manager (Node.js)

```javascript
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();

async function getSecret(secretName) {
  const data = await secretsManager
    .getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretName })
    .promise();
  return JSON.parse(data.SecretString);
}
```

### 🛠 Secrets Management Tools

| Tool                    | Features                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Securely store and manage secrets   |
| **HashiCorp Vault**     | Advanced secrets management         |
| **Doppler**             | Centralized secrets storage         |
| **Azure Key Vault**     | Manage application secrets securely |
