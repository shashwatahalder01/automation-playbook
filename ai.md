## 🔄 How to Apply AI in Test Automation

### 📌 1. Self-Healing Tests  
- AI detects UI changes & automatically updates locators.  
- Reduces flaky test failures.  

```python
# AI-powered locator
login_button = AI.find_element("login", heuristic=True)
login_button.click()
```

---

### 📌 2. AI-Based Test Generation  
- AI analyzes application behavior and auto-generates test scripts.  
- Tools like TestRigor and Diffblue Cover enable AI-generated tests.  

```python
from ai_test_generator import AutoTest

test_case = AutoTest.generate("Login flow for e-commerce app")
test_case.run()
```

---

### 📌 3. Predictive Test Execution  
- AI prioritizes test cases based on risk analysis.  
- Helps reduce test suite execution time.  

```python
high_risk_tests = AI.predict_failing_tests(test_suite)
run_tests(high_risk_tests)
```

---

### 📌 4. AI-Powered Test Data Management  
- AI generates **synthetic test data** to cover more scenarios.  
- Reduces reliance on manual test data creation.  

```python
from ai_data_generator import DataGen

test_data = DataGen.generate_synthetic_data(schema="user_profiles")
```

---

### 📌 5. Visual & UI Testing with AI  
- AI compares **screenshots, layouts, and UI elements**.  
- Detects UI changes beyond simple pixel comparison.  

```java
eyes.checkWindow("Login Page UI Test");
```
