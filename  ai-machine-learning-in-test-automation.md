# 🤖 AI & Machine Learning in Test Automation

## 📌 Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming test automation by improving efficiency, reducing maintenance, and increasing test coverage. AI-driven tools help automate complex workflows, detect anomalies, and self-heal failing tests, making automation more **reliable** and **scalable**.

## 🔹 AI-Driven Test Automation Tools

### ✅ Popular AI-Powered Tools

1. **Testim** – AI-based test creation, execution, and self-healing.
2. **Mabl** – Intelligent test automation with auto-healing capabilities.
3. **Applitools** – Visual AI for UI regression testing.
4. **Functionize** – AI-driven test case generation and execution.
5. **Sofy.ai** – AI-powered mobile test automation.

### 🏗 Example: Using Testim for AI-Powered Testing

```sh
# Install Testim CLI
yarn global add @testim/testim-cli
# Run AI-driven tests
testim --token YOUR_TESTIM_TOKEN --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## 🔹 Self-Healing Test Automation Frameworks

### ✅ Benefits of Self-Healing Tests

1. **Automatic Locator Updates** – AI detects UI changes and updates locators dynamically.
2. **Flakiness Reduction** – ML-based anomaly detection minimizes flaky test failures.
3. **Enhanced Stability** – Reduces maintenance effort by adapting to changes.

### 🏗 Example: Implementing Self-Healing in Playwright

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("AI-powered self-healing test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const loginButton = await page.locator('//button[text()="Login"]');
  await loginButton.click();
});
```

_(Modern tools like Mabl and Testim automate this self-healing process.)_

## 🔹 AI-Powered Test Case Generation

### ✅ How AI Helps Generate Test Cases

1. **Predictive Test Case Creation** – AI analyzes past failures and suggests new test cases.
2. **Code-Less Test Generation** – AI-based platforms generate tests from natural language input.
3. **Automated Exploratory Testing** – ML algorithms identify high-risk areas for additional testing.

### 🏗 Example: AI-Generated Test Scenarios

```json
{
  "test": "User Login",
  "steps": [
    "Open website",
    "Enter username",
    "Enter password",
    "Click login button",
    "Verify dashboard page"
  ]
}
```
